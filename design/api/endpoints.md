# API Endpoints

_Note: Blockchains traditionally use RPC connections, so endpoints is probably not the right terminology. For now, endpoints will refer to a point of connection for a certian functionality. Later this should be changed to RPC or another connection type._

These are the current proposed API endpoints and a description of what they do. The API will be grouped into 8 domains to keep things organized. For each endpoint specified, the Node must be able to both produce a request to that endpoint on another node and recieve a request at that endpoint.

**API Domains**:

| Domain Name | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blockchain  | Get block(s) and information about blocks from other nodes |
| Control     | Monitor and control your node                              |
| Generating  | Generate and propose new blocks                            |
| Mining      | Add transactions to blocks + mine new blocks               |
| Networking  | Manage p2p connections and network                         |
| Transaction | Create / prepare / send / verify transactions              |
| Util        | (Unsure)                                                   |
| Wallet      | Accounts / Send and recieve funds / sign trans             |

## Networking API

The networking API will allow nodes to join the p2p network and then manage their connections as a part of that network.
