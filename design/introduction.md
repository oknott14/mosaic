# Mosaic Design Docs

This folder will provide minimalistic design documentation for the Mosaic Blockchain. Mosaic's designs will draw from the already documented Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.

## API

The API documentation will cover the design of the blockchain nodes. API docs will explain how the code powering blockchain nodes is architected to allow the network to function.

## Network

The network documentation will cover the design of the Mosaic network hosted on Docker (for now). These docs will describe the P2P protocols and container configurations required to support them.
